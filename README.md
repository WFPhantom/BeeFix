# Neo Bee Fix 

### This is a Neoforge port of MacTso and lupicus' [BeeFix](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bee-fix) mod, please check their other mods out!

### Fixes:
* [MC-168329]() : Bees refuse to leave hive in end/nether
* [MC-190042]() : Bees fall when not pathfinding
* [MC-206401]() : Bees have a northwest wandering bias (might fix other mobs)
* [MC-234364]() : Bees death animation only flips them 90 degrees, instead of 180 degrees as other arthropods
* [MC-248332]() : Bees, ghasts, and phantoms can destroy turtle eggs (only Bees fixed)
